It contains all my assignments from MA544 Numerical Linear Algebra for Big Data Course. As well as my final project:  

**Unraveling Resistance: Genomic Analysis on Klebsiella Meropenem AMR:** Developed a comprehensive pipeline—from data cleaning and feature engineering to dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling—to identify key genetic markers driving Meropenem resistance.
